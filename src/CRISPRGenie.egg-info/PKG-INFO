## Why do we need this Github repo?
In general, every project has multiple codes, notebooks, scripts and plots, which are generated while working on the project's goals. Having a Git repo template to follow for a Python project helps i. standarize the file structure across the projects and users and ii. wrap all the relevant Python scripts into a Python package for easy distribution. Note that this distribution could be to different users or different compute environments for the same user.

The tutorial given here for building a Python Package is different than the typical tutorials seen on web, which uses an intermediate step of publishing it to public `pypi` server. We can't follow those tutorials for propreity code. The workflow given here avoids publishing to any public server.


## Folder structure



The folder structure should be
```
packaging_tutorial/
├── LICENSE
├── pyproject.toml
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── .gitignore
├── environment.yaml
├── README.md
├── notebooks/
├── scripts/
├── plots/
└── config/
Dockerfile
├── src/
│   └── example_package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── example.py
└── tests/
```

### Description of folders


* `notebooks/` - for storing jupyter notebooks. Standard naming convention of `yyyymmdd_<author>_<notebook title>`. For prototype notebooks include `_prototype`
* `scripts/` - Directory to store scripts for any sort of installation or processing. This could be to run models or scripts that do not belong to the python library.
* `plots/` - Store plots generated by script in scripts/ or notebook in `notebooks/`
* `tests/` - For test scripts
* `configs/` - To store any config files specific to the models. Maintain same directory structure in `example_package`
* `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Using [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks to standardize linting and processing of jupyter notebooks.
* `.gitignore` - a minimal gitignore that ignores data files, VS code configs etc. Generate this from [toptal](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)
* `environment.yaml` - Conda environment used actively for the project. micromamba recommended.
* `pyproject.toml` - Makes your python package `pip` installable!
* `Dockerfile` - Minimal Dockerfile(TBD)

## Testing

Every script in `src/example_package/script.py` should have a corresponding `tests/test_script.py`

## Local installation
If you would like to convert your Python code into a Python package that can be used widely, then follow the instructions below.
After going to the folder that contains `pyproject.toml`, use the following commands:

```
python -m build
python -m pip install dist/*.gz
```

If you would like to reinstall your package, then type:
```
rm -rf dist
python -m build && python -m pip install --upgrade dist/*.gz`
```

Note that some folks prefer specifying the package details in `setup.py`, but I recommend using `build` which I found
<a href="https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/setup-py-deprecated/">easier to use</a>.

<blockquote>
One recommended, simple, and straightforward method of building source distributions and wheels is to use the build tool with a command like python -m build which triggers the generation of both distribution formats
</blockquote>

We are using `pyproject.toml` file, which provides instructions to `build` for how to build our Python package.


Once the package has been installed, this should work anywhere in the system:

```
from example_package import example
example.add_one(2)
```

The official tutorials uses an intermediate step of publishing it to public `pypi` database, which this workflow avoids.

----------
> **Only do this after merging the latest pull request.**
----------
This step will push the latest build to the PyPi server

You can install `twine` with `pip` if necessary:
``` bash
python -m pip install twine
```
Then, once the latest PR is committed, making sure to substitute `<version>` in the code below with the version number from `pyproject.toml`, run:
``` bash
twine upload --repository-url http://dsweb.fog-inter.com/pypi/ dist/pyml-<version>.tar.gz

```
